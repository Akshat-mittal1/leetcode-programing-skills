## 📄 Problem Statement

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.  
String `t` is generated by shuffling string `s` and adding one extra character.  
Return the extra character added to `t`.

---

## 🧠 Approach

- Use the XOR operation:
  - XOR all characters in `s` and then all in `t`.
  - All characters that are the same cancel out.
  - The result is the ASCII value of the extra character.

---

## 🔢 Formula
res = 0
for i in s: res ^= ord(i)
for i in t: res ^= ord(i)
return chr(res)

## ⏱ Time & Space Complexity

| Type            | Complexity |
|-----------------|------------|
| 🕒 Time         | O(n)       |
| 💾 Space        | O(1)       |

---

## ✅ Example

```python
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
XOR of common chars cancels out: a ⊕ a, b ⊕ b, ...
Result: e → extra character

Output: "e"
```
